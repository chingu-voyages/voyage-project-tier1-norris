## Overview

You may or may not know it, but the actor and martial artist Chuck Norris has
become a cultural icon. So, you may be asking yourself "As a web development
professional why should I care about this?"

Well, the answer is that great applications don't have to center around serious
topics in order to be instructive. In fact, you can learn quite a bit working on
an app that's lighthearted and fun to work on.

With this in mind, all Tier 1 teams in Voyage 42 will be developing a Chuck
Norris facts application based on the requirements and specifications that
follow. In addition, since you will be using a simple API to retrieve these 
facts you'll be ready for Tier 2 projects in your next Voyage!


## General Instructions

This project is designed to be worked on by a team rather than an individual
Chingu. This means you and your team will need to thoroughly read and
understand the requirements and specifications below, **_and_** define and
manage your project following the _Agile Methodology_ defined in the **
[Voyage Handbook](https://www.notion.so/Voyages-8d8e16a5f86e42a88d9ace16bc555f18#c6450284edde462f8b97580b002c836e).

As you create this project make sure it meets all of the requirements, but once
it reaches MVP start implementing the optional features or get creative and
extend it in ways we haven't envisioned. In other words, use the power of
teamwork to make it distinctive and unique.

Take note that we haven't given specific direction on what your UI/UX should
look like. This is another area where you and your team can put your creativity 
to work! 

## Requirements & Specifications
### What You Need to Do

Your task for this Voyage Project is to create an app that uses the 
[Chuck Norris Facts API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to retrieve and display 
a fact about Chuck Norris either randomly, based on a category selected by your 
user, or a text string entered by your user.

#### Requirements

*Structure*

- [ ] This is a purely frontend application. No backend is required.
- [ ] Use the [Chuck Norris Facts API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to get the data you'll be presenting to the user. 
- [ ] You may use any languages, tools, or libraries you prefer when designing and building this app. 
- [ ] You may **_NOT_** use AI-base solution generators like GitHub Coilot. 

*Styling:*

- [ ] Surprise us!!!
- [ ] Add a footer containing a link to your teams GitHub repo
- [ ] In general, you will find these [UI design principles](https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/principles) helpful.

*Functionality*

- [ ] Your app should present the user with options for displaying a random fact, one based on a category selected by the user, or one based on a text string entered by the user. You have the option of optionally including this in your app since some results from the API may be offensive to some users.
- [ ] For category selection, users should be able to click on a 'Categories' element to reveal a list of categories they may choose from.
- [ ] For searching by a text string allow input in upper or lower case
- [ ] For all of the above you **_must exclude_** any quotes in the "explicit" category and optionally, those from the "religious" and "political" category (see [Chingu Community Standards](https://discord.com/channels/330284646283608064/914163956405395476/914165230119034900)). This also means that for the category selection requirement you shouldn't include "explicit" in the category list and you may also wish to exclude the other two as well.

*Upon Load:*

- [ ] Display a random Chuck Norris fact

*Other:*

- [ ] Your repo needs to have a robust [README](https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d)
- [ ] Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting

**Extras (Not Required)**

- [ ] Make your app [responsive](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/) so its UI/UX will be usable and attractive on a wide range of devices.
- [ ] Follow [A11Y principles and practices](https://www.a11yproject.com/) so your app will be accessible to users with impairments.
- [ ] Allow the user to switch between light and dark modes.
- [ ] Add animation and visual effects to capture user interest in the page.
- [ ] Add a team page to highlight members of your team. Be sure to include links to their professional and social media.
- [ ] Allow the user to define how many facts are returned at one time. The default should be 1.
- [ ] Ensure that the same fact is not displayed to the user more than once in a session.
- [ ] Give the user the option to order the list of categories alphabetically or by categories they have most frequently used in the current session.
- [ ] Add a user profile feature and keep track of metrics such as the number of facts the user has retrieve or the number of times each type of search (ie. random, catgory, text) has been used.
- [ ] Add a filter to detect results containing offensive content so they won't be displayed.
- [ ] Be creative and come up with your own new features or enhancements!
